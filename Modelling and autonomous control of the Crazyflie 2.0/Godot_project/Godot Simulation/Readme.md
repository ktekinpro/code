# Godot Part

Here, there are lots of Godot files for the simulation. But, more particulary, there is :

- drone_physique.gd : Godot script that allows us to simulate a quacopter as
a physic engine (dynamic model system equations are implemented in there),
and to communicate with Matlab through UDP.

*Codes for UDP communication are directly written in drone_physique.gd.*
