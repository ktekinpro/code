# Matlab Part

Matlab/simulink files for simulation and regulation of a quadcopter UAV.

- VariableDrone.m, Regulation_pid.mdl : Matlab and Simulink files that calculate
the speeds of the 4 motors according to the angular speeds of the quacopter.

- resolution_equation.m : resolution of the dynamic system model for
the regulation of the UAV.

*Codes for UDP communication are directly written in the .m files.*
