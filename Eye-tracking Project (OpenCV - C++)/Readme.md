# Eye-tracking Project (OpenCV - C++)

***Keywords : human-computer interaction, OpenCV, Xlib, C++***

## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to develop an application, which control the mouse of the computer according to the positions of user's eyes. To control the mouse we have implemented two algorithms : one called "joystick" and the other one "touchscreen". Each of these algorithms has been developed to respond to human-computer interaction problematic.

## How the program works

First of all, open the Makefile and write the path to your opencv directory.  
For example, if the "opencvfile" directory is in "/home/my_path/opencvfiles"  
write : PATH_TO_DIR =  /home/my_path


To compile the program, type : ~$ make

To begin, run : ~$ ./tpIHM

Then, choose what you want to do.
Finally, follow the instructions, which will be printed on the terminal.

*The program interface is in French*
