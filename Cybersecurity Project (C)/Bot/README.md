# Botnet

- Botnets send in UDP broadcast their IP. They also communicate through TCP like a server.

- The Charge_bot directory contains all the dynamic libraries that has been uploaded by the C&C.

- The Resultat_charges directory contains the outputs of the libraries's executions.

**Issues :**  
Sometimes dialogue between C&C and botnets never ends.
