# Bijective Transformations of Images (Python)

***Keywords : files manipulation, Python, images transformation***

*The program interface is in French*


The program transforms images according to the permutation functions present in the source code.

To start the program, simply press the F5 key on IDLE.

Then you just have to answer the questions that will be asked, by respecting the constraints that will be indicated to you.

In case of invalid answer (not respecting the constraints of use), you will be led to re-enter the requested element.

If you want to launch the program on the IDLE Shell (for a second use or after a shutdown on your part), type: user ()



At any time you can interrupt the execution of the script by pressing the CTRL + C keys simultaneously.

Then you can choose between closing the program (simply) or close the program by returning the documentation.
