***Keywords : Arduino, robots, autonomous vehicle, shield, PCB, obstacle avoidance, embedded systems***

End of preparatory class project.

5-month project, 2nd year of university study.

The goal was to do a racing robot.

1) In a first part, we designed the electronic model & the PCB.

2) Then we developed its chassis.

3) Finally we programmed the arduino.

At the end, the robot moved autonomously, by avoiding obstacles. He could also communicate by IR.
