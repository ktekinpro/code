# Games based on Arduino and ESP8266 (C++)

***Keywords :  IoT, embedded systems, C++***

A few examples of games I programmed during my 2019 internship.

My work was divided into 3 parts :

- scenario analysis : what is the purpose of the game? How will the player react to the game ?
Is the resolution too easy ? Too hard ?

- electronic assembly : technical documentation, assembly, welding

- C++ programming : installation of libraries that are necessary for the use of electronic components
which are connected to our development board (Arduino, ESP), Wifi communication for IOT ("Internet of Things"),
development of game algorithms.
