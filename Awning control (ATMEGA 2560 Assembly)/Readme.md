# Awning control (ATMEGA 2560 Assembly)

***Keywords : ATMEGA assembly, Arduino, embedded systems***

The goal was to develop an efficient system, according to the specifications.

Here, we had to develop an awning control systems, which control an awning with manual and autonomous modes, according to the customer.

We developed the hardware architecture, and then we programmed it in assembly on the ATMEGA 2560.
