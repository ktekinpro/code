# ATMEGA2560 Assembly Exercices

***Keywords : assembly, Arduino, embedded system, pseudocode, polling, interrupts***

These exercices aimed to make us understand the subtlety between polling and interrupts. In addition to these practical work we followed theoretical and practical courses, in order to master the assembly code on this architecture.

**Introduction & parallel port**  
* TP10 : LED blinking & push-button
* TP11 : LED chase
* TP12 : counter
* TP13 : digital display

**Parallel port & interrupts**  
* TP20 : watchdog
* TP21 : LED chase using interrupts
* TP22 : counter using interrupts & watchdog
* TP23 : oven control

**Analog to digital conversion**
* TP30 : getting started with ADC converter   
* TP31 : temperature sensor
* TP32 : distance sensor
* TP33 : central heating controller

**Serial communication**
* TP40 : introduction to serial communication   
* TP41 : communication with the circuit board
* TP42 : surveillance system
